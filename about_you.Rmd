## A short history of you.

 For this class  you need a computer you can use at home.  So, what kind is it (windows, Apple, Linux)?

 I've been to Indiana which is completely across the state of the US. That is about the furthest I've traveled. My uncle I think was in the military, but I did not know him well to even ask or see him. I really don't know whcih branch I would be in honestly.
